# About Me
I have bachelor's degree in Optics and Laser Technologies. When writing my graduation diploma I coded a simple program to control optical tweezer on C# that implements image processing.

After graduating from university, I decided slightly change and expand my occupation. This lend me to studying computer vision. To better understand this topic I started looking into machine learning and deep learning techniques. The first step was taking RSSchool ML intro course. Studying ML&DL requires a deep understanding of the mathematical apparatus. Therefore at the moment I'm expanding my knowledge in linear algebra, probability and statistics.

Also I often had to parse websites for my own purposes, so I decided to take FE/JS course.
